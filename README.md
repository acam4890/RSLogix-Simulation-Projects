This program controls a pump using only digital signals. A pump is powered on until the pressure in a tank reaches 110 PSI. At 110 PSI a pressure switch is closed, the program then de-energizes the pump. Once the pressure falls below 90 PSI, a 90 PSI pressure switch is opened and the pump is re-energized. Whenever the pressure inside the tank is above 90 PSI (90 PSI switch is closed), a "run" indicator light is powered on.
