Program for measuring the oil flowing  through a pipeline in Gallons per Minute. A digital rotameter sends a pulse to the PLC after 6.3 gallons of oil flow past it. The rotameter pulse is stored in a binary file rather than a digital input because we want to control when the pulse is sent for simulation reasons.
