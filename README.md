An O2 sensor reads how much oxygen is present in the air from 0% - 40% oxygen concentration. The O2 sensor is susceptible to degradation resulting in inaccurate readings over time. This is remedied by calibrating the O2 sensor readings in our PLC program. This program controls two valves. One valve holds gas with 0% oxygen concentration and the other valves holds gas with 30% oxygen concentration. If the system is placed into "calibration mode", the program opens the 0% gas valve for 30 seconds and takes readings to calculate an average. Once complete, the program then opens the 30% gas valve for 30 seconds and takes readings to calculate an average. The program uses the average readings of these two known O2 concentrations to calibrate the scaling (raw values -> O2 percentage values) of the O2 sensor readings.
