This program measures the time a system is running up to a max of 1,000,000 hours. It displays seconds, minutes, hours, and hours (x1000). If the system is shutdown and powered on again, the timer will continue
measuring time starting from the time recorded right before the system was shutdown. If the operator wishes to reset the timer, they will need to hit the reset button.
