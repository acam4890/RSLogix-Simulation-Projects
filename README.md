Somewhat similar to the digital pump control, this program controls a VFD that controls a pump using logic meant to substitute PID as a programming excercise. The vacuum sensor measures pressure in the tank by inch of mercury in a range of 0-30 in/Hg. The program keeps maintains the pressure at a desired setpoint. The output sent to the VFD for controlling the pump is adjusted based on the % difference of the measured vacuum from the desired setpoint.
